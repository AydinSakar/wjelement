<h1>About</h1>
<p>
WJElement - JSON manipulation in C
</p>
<p>
WJElement is a very flexible JSON library developed by Messaging Architects.
It was created for MA's "WARP" webserver, and is built on top of the (also-
included) lower-level WJReader and WJWriter libraries.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
WJReader and WJWriter are optimized for speed and memory-efficiency.
</li>
<li>
WJElement focuses on flexibility and handy features, allowing C code to
manipulate JSON documents with as few statements (fewer, sometimes!) as
JavaScript itself.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>License</h1>
<p>
WJElement and its related libraries may be consumed in any project,
open or closed, as outlined by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt">GNU Lesser
General Public License</a>.
Include it as-is and link to it
from your code, massage it into your own statically-linked package, or use it
in ways we haven't thought of.  Read the docs/headers, have fun, and if you
use it for something awesome, let us know about it!  :^)

<h1>Quirks</h1>
<p>
In the spirit of being upfront, and to help you guage whether WJElement is
right for you without asking you to invest too much time, it should be noted
that there are a few things this library currently does not do particularly
well, or in a generally-useful fashion, or handles in a seemingly-awkward
way...
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
XplBool return values
 <ul>
 <li>
   Many functions return TRUE on success.  Deal.  :^)
 </li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>
Floating-point number values (unimplemented)
 <ul>
 <li>
   WJElement does not support floats, because we don't need them, at least
   not yet.
 </li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://json-schema.org">Schema</a> validation (useful, incomplete)
 <ul>
 <li>
   "format" validation on strings is unimplemented.  The json-schema draft
   specification allows this to be missing, and so far, so do we.
 </li>
 <li>
   "backlinks"... This is something we're making use of in netmail, but is not
   part of the base json-schema spec.  You can safely ignore it (or dig in and
   use it, why not?  :^)
 </li>
 </ul>
<li>
Libraries, headers (stubs and #define's)
 <ul>
 <li>
   Xpl (cross-platform library) provides a consistent set of utility
   functions within netmail.  WJElement uses a subset of these functions
   and definitions, so they have been included.
 </li>
 <li>
   MemMgr (memory manager) provides optimized, slab-based memory management
   in netmail; for the sake of a general WJElement release, the MemMgr API
   simply calls malloc et al.
 </li>
 </ul>
</li>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You are free and encouraged to add (and contribute back ;^) these features if
you are so inclined.  In most cases, there are comments or even empty code
blocks, just waiting to be filled in.  WJElement is great, but you can make it
even better!
